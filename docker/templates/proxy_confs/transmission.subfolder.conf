# Transmission does not require a base url setting
#
# Some Transmission Chrome extensions cannot handle HTTP/2 proxies as they
# rely on the HTTP Status Text to determine if they should add the
# X-Transmission-Session-Id header or not. HTTP/2 does not return this text
# so jQuery responses are empty. This causes RPCs to fail.
#
# If your extension is affected, you can remove http2 from the default server
# in /config/nginx/site-confs/default or listen on a different port that has
# no http2 servers defined. Better yet, submit a bug report with the
# extension developer to fix their extensions to support HTTP/2.
